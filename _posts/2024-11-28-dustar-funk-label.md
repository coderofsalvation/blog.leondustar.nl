title: Liberating things inside and around me.
---

Some time has passed, but that does not mean inactivity.<br>
On the contrary, I haven't stopped using my electribes & favorite tracker-software (sunvox & milkytracker).<br>
Also, the [meanwhile easier] selfhosted web has sparked my interest again (due to a spotify-hangover).<br>
Particularly with [RSS](https://openrss.org/guides/what-are-rss-feeds) feeds, ActivityPub and 'run-your-own-spotify/bandcamp'-generators like [faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/).<br>
My aim is to gradually move over the Du Star Funk-label to my own server and mirror it to [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/leon-du-star-balatonion-funk).<br>
I hope to share more updates soon!
